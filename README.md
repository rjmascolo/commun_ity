# commun_ity

### What is it? ###

Commun_ity is a web app that connects users to different communities they want to be apart of and lets them see different events within that community. It works similarly to MeetUp but with Commun_ity, users can volunteer for tasks they would like to sign up for. For example, your group is having a potluck and you need someone to bring mashed potatoes, turkey, greenbean cassorole, and some drinks. Different users can opt-in to bring some of these items to your event.

### How is it built? ###

This application is built using Javascript and Ruby. The backend is powered via Ruby On Rails API, while the front-end is using React.js and utializes Semantic UI's React library.
